/**
 * This class implements the <tt>Set</tt> interface, backed by a hash table
 * (actually a <tt>HashMap</tt> instance).  It makes no guarantees as to the
 * iteration order of the set; in particular, it does not guarantee that the
 * order will remain constant over time.  This class permits the <tt>null</tt>
 * element.<p>
 *
 * This class offers constant time performance for the basic operations
 * (<tt>add</tt>, <tt>remove</tt>, <tt>contains</tt> and <tt>size</tt>),
 * assuming the hash function disperses the elements properly among the
 * buckets.  Iterating over this set requires time proportional to the sum of
 * the <tt>HashSet</tt> instance's size (the number of elements) plus the
 * "capacity" of the backing <tt>HashMap</tt> instance (the number of
 * buckets).  Thus, it's very important not to set the initial capacity too
 * high (or the load factor too low) if iteration performance is important.<p>
 *
 * <b>Note that this implementation is not synchronized.</b> If multiple
 * threads access a set concurrently, and at least one of the threads modifies
 * the set, it <i>must</i> be synchronized externally.  This is typically
 * accomplished by synchronizing on some object that naturally encapsulates
 * the set.  If no such object exists, the set should be "wrapped" using the
 * <tt>Collections.synchronizedSet</tt> method.  This is best done at creation
 * time, to prevent accidental unsynchronized access to the <tt>HashSet</tt>
 * instance:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     Set s = Collections.synchronizedSet(new HashSet(...));
 * </pre><p>
 *
 * The iterators returned by this class's <tt>iterator</tt> method are
 * <i>fail-fast</i>: if the set is modified at any time after the iterator is
 * created, in any way except through the iterator's own <tt>remove</tt>
 * method, the Iterator throws a <tt>ConcurrentModificationException</tt>.
 * Thus, in the face of concurrent modification, the iterator fails quickly
 * and cleanly, rather than risking arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at
 * an undetermined time in the future.
 *
 * <p>Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed
 * as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the
 * presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification.  Fail-fast iterators
 * throw <tt>ConcurrentModificationException</tt> on a best-effort basis.
 * Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this
 * exception for its correctness: <i>the fail-fast behavior of iterators
 * should be used only to detect bugs.</i><p>
 *
 * This class is a member of the
 * <a href="{@docRoot}/../guide/collections/index.html">
