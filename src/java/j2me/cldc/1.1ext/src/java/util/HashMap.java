/**
 * Hash table based implementation of the <tt>Map</tt> interface.  This
 * implementation provides all of the optional map operations, and permits
 * <tt>null</tt> values and the <tt>null</tt> key.  (The <tt>HashMap</tt>
 * class is roughly equivalent to <tt>Hashtable</tt>, except that it is
 * unsynchronized and permits nulls.)  This class makes no guarantees as to
 * the order of the map; in particular, it does not guarantee that the order
 * will remain constant over time.
 *
 * <p>This implementation provides constant-time performance for the basic
 * operations (<tt>get</tt> and <tt>put</tt>), assuming the hash function
 * disperses the elements properly among the buckets.  Iteration over
 * collection views requires time proportional to the "capacity" of the
 * <tt>HashMap</tt> instance (the number of buckets) plus its size (the number
 * of key-value mappings).  Thus, it's very important not to set the initial
 * capacity too high (or the load factor too low) if iteration performance is
 * important.
 *
 * <p>An instance of <tt>HashMap</tt> has two parameters that affect its
 * performance: <i>initial capacity</i> and <i>load factor</i>.  The
 * <i>capacity</i> is the number of buckets in the hash table, and the initial
 * capacity is simply the capacity at the time the hash table is created.  The
 * <i>load factor</i> is a measure of how full the hash table is allowed to
 * get before its capacity is automatically increased.  When the number of
 * entries in the hash table exceeds the product of the load factor and the
 * current capacity, the capacity is roughly doubled by calling the
 * <tt>rehash</tt> method.
 *
 * <p>As a general rule, the default load factor (.75) offers a good tradeoff
 * between time and space costs.  Higher values decrease the space overhead
 * but increase the lookup cost (reflected in most of the operations of the
 * <tt>HashMap</tt> class, including <tt>get</tt> and <tt>put</tt>).  The
 * expected number of entries in the map and its load factor should be taken
 * into account when setting its initial capacity, so as to minimize the
 * number of <tt>rehash</tt> operations.  If the initial capacity is greater
 * than the maximum number of entries divided by the load factor, no
 * <tt>rehash</tt> operations will ever occur.
 *
 * <p>If many mappings are to be stored in a <tt>HashMap</tt> instance,
 * creating it with a sufficiently large capacity will allow the mappings to
 * be stored more efficiently than letting it perform automatic rehashing as
 * needed to grow the table.
 *
 * <p><b>Note that this implementation is not synchronized.</b> If multiple
 * threads access this map concurrently, and at least one of the threads
 * modifies the map structurally, it <i>must</i> be synchronized externally.
 * (A structural modification is any operation that adds or deletes one or
 * more mappings; merely changing the value associated with a key that an
 * instance already contains is not a structural modification.)  This is
 * typically accomplished by synchronizing on some object that naturally
 * encapsulates the map.  If no such object exists, the map should be
 * "wrapped" using the <tt>Collections.synchronizedMap</tt> method.  This is
 * best done at creation time, to prevent accidental unsynchronized access to
 * the map: <pre> Map m = Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap(...));
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>The iterators returned by all of this class's "collection view methods"
 * are <i>fail-fast</i>: if the map is structurally modified at any time after
 * the iterator is created, in any way except through the iterator's own
 * <tt>remove</tt> or <tt>add</tt> methods, the iterator will throw a
 * <tt>ConcurrentModificationException</tt>.  Thus, in the face of concurrent
 * modification, the iterator fails quickly and cleanly, rather than risking
 * arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined time in the
 * future.
 *
 * <p>Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed
 * as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the
 * presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification.  Fail-fast iterators
 * throw <tt>ConcurrentModificationException</tt> on a best-effort basis. 
 * Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this
 * exception for its correctness: <i>the fail-fast behavior of iterators
 * should be used only to detect bugs.</i>
